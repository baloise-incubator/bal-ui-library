Meta links can also be created by simply passing the `href` and `target` attributes along with the `buttons` component property.

```ts
[
  {
    icon: 'web',
    touchPlacement: 'bottom',
    ariaLabel: 'Baloise',
    htmlTitle: 'Baloise',
    href: 'http://www.baloise.ch',
    target: '_blank'
  },
  ...
]
```
