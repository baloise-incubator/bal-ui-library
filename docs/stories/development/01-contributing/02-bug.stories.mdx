## 1. Report an issue

> **HINT** only when you are reporting a bug

To begin the process, the first step is to create an issue at the following URL: [https://github.com/baloise/design-system/issues](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/issues).

This is where you will describe the bug you have found.

import CreateABug from '../../assets/images/contribution/create-bug.gif'

<img src={CreateABug} />

## 2. Generate a branch

## 3. Write a test

Prior to initiating the bug-fixing process, write a test case that can reproduce the bug.
This test case serves as a means to verify the existence of the bug and ensures that the fix adequately addresses the issue without introducing new problems.

## 4. Fix the bug

Once you have the test in place to reproduce the bug, you can proceed with the bug-fixing process.

## 5. Add changeset

## 6. Finalize your PR
