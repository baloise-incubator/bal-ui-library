## 15.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1271](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1271) - Introduce a new property `auto-invalid-off` to exclude a form control in Angular reactive forms from being visibly set as invalid.

### Patch Changes

- [#1266](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1266) - The term `hidden` is a reserved accessibility (a11y) value. Consequently, we found it necessary to rename our hidden properties for checkboxes, radio buttons, tabs, and steps.
  The attribute remains in place for now, ensuring no breaking changes at this time.

  The `hidden` property for the checkbox and radio has been updated and renamed to `non-submit.`
  The `hidden` property for the tabs and steps has been updated and renamed to `invisible.`

- [#1264](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1264) - The radio and checkbox group component now updates its children when there are changes in the disabled or invalid status.

- [#1260](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1260) - The horizontal form field now lacks right padding, and the label is aligned to the right.

- [#1265](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1265) - Corrected the z-index value for the carousel component with sticky controls.

- [#1261](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1261) - The navigation component now provides enhanced support for colored service cards on mobile resolutions.

- [#1269](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1269) - Enable vertical scrolling for the `carousel` with tab controls on mobile devices.

- [#1263](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1263) - The Angular component `bal-ng-error` is now more synchronized with Angular lifecycles, ensuring improved visibility and hiding of validation messages.

- [#1262](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1262) - Merges styles from `<style>` elements to the style attribute of matching elements.

## 15.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127) - Removed the deprecated option of component styles with SASS. Instead, for customizing the component design, use CSS Variables.

- [#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127) - The option to `applyPolyfills` for outdated browsers such as IE11 and legacy Edge has been deprecated, as the current design system no longer provides support for these versions.

- [#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127) - Now by default the Baloise Design System will mark a form control as invalid when it's been touched and is indeed invalid.
  To disable this feature, set setInvalid to false in the design system configuration.

  ```ts
  BaloiseDesignSystemModule.forRoot({
    defaults: { ... },
    forms: {
      setInvalid: false, // to deactivate it
    },
  })
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127) - All components are now available as standalone elements for Angular v17.

  Use the `provideBaloiseDesignSystem` provider within the app.config.ts file, where Angular providers are typically defined.

  **app.config.ts**

  ```ts
  import { ApplicationConfig, importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core'

  import { provideBaloiseDesignSystem } from '@baloise/design-system-components-angular/standalone'

  export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [provideBaloiseDesignSystem()],
  }
  ```

  In each app component, import the necessary Baloise Design System components or a bundled set.

  **app.component.ts**

  ```ts
  import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, Component } from '@angular/core'
  import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common'
  import { BalApp, BalButton } from '@baloise/design-system-components-angular/standalone'

  export interface UpdateControl {
    name: string
    value: any
  }

  @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
    imports: [CommonModule, BalApp, BalButton],
    template: `
      <bal-app>
        <main class="container py-normal">
          <bal-button>My Button</bal-button>
        </main>
      </bal-app>
    `,
  })
  export class AppComponent {}
  ```

#### Webpack builder

For projects based on the builder `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` use the `@baloise/design-system-components-angular/legacy`.
