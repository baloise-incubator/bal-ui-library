## Examples

<span id="story--components-form-date--field-control" style={{ opacity: 0 }}></span>

### Field Control

Elevate your user experience even further by seamlessly merging the component with the `bal-field` components.
This not only facilitates the addition of labels, validation messages, and other crucial elements but also ensures
that required accessibility features are seamlessly integrated. This approach guarantees an inclusive and user-friendly interface for all.

<span id="story--components-form-date--manual-input" style={{ opacity: 0 }}></span>

### Manual Input

Explore another practical application of the component where the datepicker's popup is triggered solely by clicking on an icon.
This specialized use case is particularly valuable when dealing with well-known dates such as birthdays. By implementing this approach,
you streamline the user experience, making it convenient to quickly input or verify specific dates without the need for an
extensive calendar interface.

<Canvas className="has-visible-overflow">
  <Story id="components-form-date--manual-input" />
</Canvas>

<span id="story--components-form-date--min" style={{ opacity: 0 }}></span>
<span id="story--components-form-date--max" style={{ opacity: 0 }}></span>
<span id="story--components-form-date--min-and-max" style={{ opacity: 0 }}></span>

### Min and Max

Utilize the `min` and `max` props to establish a flexible range of available dates within the datepicker component.
By setting the min prop, you can specify the earliest permissible date that users can select. Conversely, with
the max prop, you can determine the latest date that can be chosen.

These props are invaluable when you need to restrict date selection within a specific timeframe, such as
when scheduling appointments or bookings. By configuring the min and max props, you ensure that users can
only choose dates that fall within the designated range, offering a tailored and controlled date selection experience.

## Component Api

## Integration

Value must be a date string following the [ISO 8601 datetime format standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime),
`1996-12-19`. The format does not have to be specific to an exact datetime.
For example, the maximum could just be the year, such as `1994`. Defaults to the end of this year.

```typescript
import { BalDate } from '@baloise/design-system-components'

const dateDisabled = document.getElementById('date-disabled')
dateDisabled.value = BalDate.fromAnyFormat(new Date()).toISODate()
// or
dateDisabled.value = BalDate.fromAnyFormat(new Date(2020, 0, 13)).toISODate()
// or
dateDisabled.value = BalDate.fromISO('2020-01-13').toISODate()
```
